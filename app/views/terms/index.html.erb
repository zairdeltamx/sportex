          <h1>Terms Of Service SportX</h1>
          <h2>Last Updated: April 4, 2023</h2>
        </section>

        <hr />
        <section id="introduction">
          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <p>
            Welcome to NFT SportX, owned and operated by AXTION Technologys SA
            de CV. These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and
            use of the NFT SportX website(s), our APIs, mobile applications
            (“App”), and any live support, software, tools, features, or
            functionalities provided on or in connection with our services;
            including without limitation using our services to view, explore,
            help display and create NFTs, and using our tools, at your own
            discretion, to connect directly with others to mint, purchase, sell,
            or transfer NFTs on public blockchains (collectively, the
            “Service”). “NFT” in these Terms means a non-fungible token or
            similar digital item implemented on a blockchain (such as the BNB
            blockchain), which uses smart contracts to link to or otherwise be
            associated with certain content or data. For purposes of these
            Terms, “user”, “you”, and “your” mean you as the user of the
            Service. If you use the Service on behalf of a company or other
            entity then “you” includes you and that entity, and you represent
            and warrant that (a) you are an authorized representative of the
            entity with the authority to bind the entity to these Terms, and (b)
            you agree to these Terms on the entity’s behalf. PLEASE READ THESE
            TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY AS THEY CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND
            AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. AS OUTLINED IN SECTION 16 BELOW, THEY
            INCLUDE A MANDATORY ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER
            WHICH (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS) REQUIRE ANY DISPUTES BETWEEN US TO
            BE RESOLVED THROUGH INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN BY A JUDGE OR
            JURY IN COURT. BY CLICKING TO ACCEPT, SIGN, AND/OR USING OUR
            SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND ALL OF THE TERMS
            INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE
            TERMS, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE. NFT SportX is not a
            wallet provider, exchange, broker, dealer, financial institution,
            payments processor, money services business, or creditor. NFT SportX
            provides a peer-to-peer web3 service that helps users discover and
            directly interact with each other and NFTs available on public
            blockchains. We do not have custody or control over the NFTs or
            blockchains you are interacting with and we do not execute or
            effectuate purchases, or transfers of NFTs. To use our Service, you
            must use a third-party wallet which allows you to engage in
            transactions on blockchains. Because we have a growing number of
            services, we sometimes need to provide additional terms for specific
            services (and such services are deemed part of the “Service”
            hereunder and shall also be subject to these Terms). Those
            additional terms and conditions, which are available with the
            relevant service, then become part of your agreement with us if you
            use those services. In the event of a conflict between these Terms
            and any additional applicable terms we may provide for a specific
            service, such additional terms shall control for that specific
            service. NFT SportX reserves the right to change or modify these
            Terms at any time and in our sole discretion. If we make material
            changes to these Terms, we will use reasonable efforts to provide
            notice of such changes, such as by providing notice through the
            Service or updating the “Last Updated” date at the beginning of
            these Terms. By continuing to access or use the Service, you confirm
            your acceptance of the revised Terms and all of the terms
            incorporated therein by reference effective as of the date these
            Terms are updated. It is your sole responsibility to review the
            Terms from time to time to view such changes and to ensure that you
            understand the terms and conditions that apply when you access or
            use the Service.

          <h1>Accessing the Service</h1>
          <p>
            Like much of web3, your blockchain address functions as your
            identity on NFT SportX. Accordingly, you will need a blockchain
            address and a third-party wallet to access the Service. Your account
            on the Service (“Account”) will be associated with your blockchain
            address. Your participation on NFT SportX will be associated with
            your linked blockchain address and display the NFTs for that
            blockchain address (and, if applicable, any content associated with
            such NFTs). By using your wallet in connection with the Service, you
            agree that you are using that wallet under the terms and conditions
            of the applicable provider of the wallet. Wallets are not operated
            by, maintained by, or affiliated with NFT SportX, and NFT SportX
            does not have custody or control over the contents of your wallet
            and has no ability to retrieve or transfer its contents. NFT SportX
            accepts no responsibility for, or liability to you, in connection
            with your use of a wallet and makes no representations or warranties
            regarding how the Service will operate with any specific wallet. You
            are solely responsible for keeping your wallet secure and you should
            never share your wallet credentials or seed phrase with anyone. If
            you discover an issue related to your wallet, please contact your
            wallet provider. Likewise, you are solely responsible for your
            Account and any associated wallet and we are not liable for any acts
            or omissions by you in connection with your Account or as a result
            of your Account or wallet being compromised. You agree to
            immediately notify us if you discover or otherwise suspect any
            security issues related to the Service or your Account (you can
            contact us here). You also represent and warrant that you will
            comply with all applicable laws (e.g., local, state, federal and
            other laws)in connection with using the Service. In order to comply
            with our legal obligations and keep our users and platform safe, we
            may need to restrict, suspend, or terminate your access to the
            Service. You acknowledge that NFT SportX is under no obligation to
            disclose the details of its decision to take such action with you.
            Without limiting the foregoing, by using the Service, you represent
            and warrant that: (a) you are not located in, ordinarily resident
            in, or organized under the laws of any jurisdiction that is subject
            to a comprehensive U.S. Government embargo ("Embargoed
            Jurisdiction"); (b) you are not subject to any sanctions
            administered by an agency of the U.S. Government, any other
            government, or the United Nations (collectively, “Sanctions”); (c)
            you are not owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by any
            person that is subject to Sanctions, or that is located in,
            ordinarily resident in, or organized under the laws of, any
            Embargoed Jurisdiction; (d) none of your officers, managers,
            directors, shareholders or authorized representatives is subject to
            Sanctions, or is located in, ordinarily resident in, or organized
            under the laws of, any Embargoed Jurisdiction, or is owned or
            controlled, directly or indirectly, by any person that is subject to
            Sanctions or that is located in, ordinarily resident in, or
            organized under the laws of, any Embargoed Jurisdiction; (e) you
            have not transacted and will not transact with any person or entity
            falling into any of (a)-(d); (f) you have not transacted and will
            not transact for the benefit of any person or entity falling into
            any of (a)-(d). You further covenant that the foregoing shall be
            true during the entire period of this agreement. If you access or
            use the Service outside the United States, you are solely
            responsible for ensuring that your access and use of the Service in
            such country, territory or jurisdiction does not violate any
            applicable laws. NFT SportX may require you to provide additional
            information and documents in certain circumstances, such as at the
            request of any government authority, as any applicable law or
            regulation dictates, to provide you with a requested service, or to
            investigate a potential violation of these Terms. In such cases, NFT
            SportX, in its sole discretion, may block your ability to access the
            Service until such additional information and documents are
            processed by NFT SportX. If you do not provide complete and accurate
            information in response to such a request, NFT SportX may refuse to
            restore your access to the Service. Your access and use of the
            Service may be interrupted from time to time for any of several
            reasons, including, without limitation, the malfunction of
            equipment, periodic updating, maintenance, or repair of the Service,
            geographic restrictions, potential violation of these Terms, or
            other actions that NFT SportX, in its sole discretion, may elect to
            take. You understand that NFT SportX, in its sole discretion, may
            disable your Account and/or reassign your username or associated
            url. We require all users to be at least 18 years old. If you are at
            least 13 years old but under 18 years old, you may only use NFT
            SportX through a parent or guardian’s Account and with their
            approval and oversight. That account holder is responsible for your
            actions using the Account. It is prohibited to use our Service if
            you are under 13 years old.

            INCLUDING FORKS, TECHNICAL NODE ISSUES OR ANY OTHER ISSUES HAVING
            LOSSES OR INJURY AS A RESULT. Some jurisdictions do not allow the
            exclusion of implied warranties in contracts with consumers, so the
            above exclusion may not apply to you. Assumption of Risk You accept
            and acknowledge: The value of an NFT is subjective. Prices of NFTs
            are subject to volatility and fluctuations in the price of
            cryptocurrency can also materially and adversely affect NFT prices.
            You acknowledge that you fully understand this subjectivity and
            volatility and that you may lose money. You understand that you are
            responsible for any fees related to use of the Service, including
            for actions you take on the blockchain, regardless of whether a
            successful transaction occurs, and that such fees are final and
            irreversible. A lack of use or public interest in the creation and
            development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the
            development of those ecosystems and related applications, and could
            therefore also negatively impact the potential utility of NFTs. The
            regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, non-fungible
            tokens, cryptocurrency, and other crypto-based items is uncertain,
            and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the
            development of the Service and the utility of NFTs. You are solely
            responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your
            transactions and to withhold, collect, report, and remit the correct
            amounts of taxes to the appropriate tax authorities. NFT SportX is
            not responsible for determining, withholding, collecting, reporting,
            or remitting any taxes that apply to your NFTs or the sale/purchase
            of your NFTs. There are risks associated with purchasing items
            associated with content created by third parties through
            peer-to-peer transactions, including but not limited to, the risk of
            purchasing counterfeit items, mislabeled items, items that are
            vulnerable to metadata decay, items on smart contracts with bugs,
            and items that may become untransferable. You represent and warrant
            that you have done sufficient research before making any decisions
            to sell, obtain, transfer, or otherwise interact with any NFTs or
            accounts/collections. We do not have ownership or control of the
            smart contracts deployed by third parties, and are not responsible
            and make no guarantees regarding their operation and functionality.
            We do not control the public blockchains that you are interacting
            with and we do not control certain smart contracts and protocols
            that may be integral to your ability to complete transactions on
            these public blockchains. Additionally, blockchain transactions are
            irreversible and NFT SportX has no ability to reverse any
            transactions on the blockchain. There are risks associated with
            using Internet and blockchain based products, including, but not
            limited to, the risk associated with hardware, software, and
            Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction,
            and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to
            your third-party wallet or Account. You accept and acknowledge that
            NFT SportX will not be responsible for any communication failures,
            disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when
            using the Service or any Blockchain network, however caused. NFT
            SportX reserves the right to hide collections, contracts, and items
            affected by any of these issues or by other issues. Items you
            purchase may become inaccessible on NFT SportX. Under no
            circumstances shall the inability to view items on NFT SportX or an
            inability to use the Service in conjunction with the purchase, sale,
            or transfer of items available on any blockchains serve as grounds
            for a claim against NFT SportX. If you have a dispute with one or
            more users, YOU RELEASE US FROM CLAIMS, DEMANDS, AND DAMAGES OF
            EVERY KIND AND NATURE, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY

          <h1>Dispute Resolution; Arbitration</h1>
          <p>
            Dispute Resolution. Please read the following arbitration agreement
            in this Section (“Arbitration Agreement”) carefully. It requires you
            to arbitrate disputes with NFR SportX and limits the manner in which
            you can seek relief from us. This section does not govern disputes
            between users or between users and third parties. NFT SportX does
            not provide dispute resolution services for such disagreements and
            the parties must resolve those disputes directly. Applicability of
            Arbitration Agreement. You agree that any dispute, controversy, or
            claim relating in any way to your access or use of the Service, to
            any products sold or distributed through the Service, or to any
            aspect of your relationship with NFT SportX, will be resolved by
            binding arbitration, rather than in court, including threshold
            questions of the arbitrability of such dispute, controversy, or
            claim except that (1) you or NFT SportX may assert claims in small
            claims court, but only if the claims qualify, the claims remain only
            in such court, and the claims remain on an individual,
            non-representative, and non-class basis; and (2) you or NFT SportX
            may seek injunctive or equitable relief in a court of proper
            jurisdiction if the claim relates to intellectual property
            infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
            Dispute resolution process. You and NFT SportX both agree to engage
            in good-faith efforts to resolve disputes prior to either party
            initiating an arbitration, small claims court proceeding, or
            equitable relief for intellectual property infringement. You must
            initiate this dispute resolution process by sending a letter
            describing the nature of your claim and desired resolution to: NFT
            SportX, Attn: Legal Department, Blvd. Corporativo No. 135 Col. Los
            Parques CP 25279 Saltillo, Coah. Mex. Both parties agree to meet and
            confer personally, by telephone, or by videoconference (hereinafter
            “Conference”) to discuss the dispute and attempt in good faith to
            reach a mutually beneficial outcome that avoids the expenses of
            arbitration or, where applicable, litigation. If you are represented
            by counsel, your counsel may participate in the Conference as well,
            but you agree to fully participate in the Conference. Likewise, if
            NFT SportX is represented by counsel, its counsel may participate in
            the Conference as well, but NFT SportX agrees to have a company
            representative fully participate in the Conference. The statute of
            limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the
            parties engage in the informal dispute resolution process and
            Conference required by this paragraph. If the parties do not reach
            agreement to resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days after
            initiation of this dispute resolution process, either party may
            commence arbitration, file an action in small claims court, or file
            a claim for injunctive or equitable relief in a court of proper
            jurisdiction for matters relating to intellectual property
            infringement, if the claims qualify. Arbitration Rules and Forum.
            The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and
            enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration
            proceeding after participating in the dispute resolution process,
            you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your
            claim to our office, Attn: Legal Department, Blvd. Corporativo No.
            135 Col. Los Parques CP 25279 Saltillo, Coah. Mex. The arbitration
            will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute
            resolution provider. Disputes involving claims and counterclaims
            under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees, interest, claimed
            punitive or other damages, or any claim in excess of the bona fide
            verifiable value of actual lost property shall be subject to JAMS’s
            most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and the
            JAMS Consumer Minimum Standards then in effect; all other claims
            shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive
            Arbitration Rules and Procedures and the JAMS Consumer Minimum
            Standards then in effect. JAMS’s rules are available at jamsadr.com
            or by calling JAMS at 800-352- 5267. If JAMS is not available to
            arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. If
            the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS filing,
            administrative, hearing, and/or other fees and cannot obtain a
            waiver from JAMS, NFT SportX will pay them for you if you complied
            with the dispute resolution process set forth above. In addition,
            NFT SportX will reimburse all such JAMS filing, administrative,
            hearing, and/or other fees for claims totaling less than $10,000
            unless (a) a resolution of your claim results in a smaller monetary
            judgment than NFT SportX may have offered you to settle the claim,
            at any point, or (b) the arbitrator determines the claims are
            frivolous or you did not comply with the dispute resolution process
            set forth above, except that if you have initiated the arbitration
            claim, you will still be required to pay the lesser of $250 or the
            maximum amount permitted under the JAMS Rules for arbitration claims
            initiated by you. You are still responsible for all additional costs
            that you incur in the arbitration, including without limitation,
            fees for attorneys or expert witnesses. You may choose to have the
            arbitration conducted by telephone or videoconference, based on
            written submissions, in person in your hometown area (if you live in
            the United States), or at another mutually agreed upon location that
            is reasonably convenient to you. Any judgment on the award rendered
            by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent
            jurisdiction. Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have
            exclusive authority to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of
            this Arbitration Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to
            the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of
            this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim
            that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or
            voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if
            any, of you and NFT SportX. The arbitration proceeding will not be
            consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases
            or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions
            dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have
            the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any
            non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under
            applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and these Terms. The
            arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision
            describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award
            is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The
            arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual
            basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the
            arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. Waiver of Jury
            Trial. YOU AND NFT SPORTX HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND
            STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A
            JUDGE OR A JURY. You and NFT SportX are instead electing that all
            claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this
            Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in the second bullet of
            this Section 16, above (“Applicability of Arbitration Agreement”).
            An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and
            relief as a court and must follow these Terms as a court would.
            However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review
            of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review. Waiver of
            Class Actions and Class Arbitrations. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN
            THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN
            INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A REPRESENTATIVE (INCLUDING, WITHOUT
            LIMITATION, PAGA) OR COLLECTIVE CLASS BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF
            IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE USER, PERSON, OR ENTITY
            CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER USER,
            PERSON, OR ENTITY. Accordingly, under the arbitration procedures
            outlined in this section, an arbitrator shall not combine or
            consolidate more than one party’s claims without the written consent
            of all affected parties to an arbitration proceeding. Without
            limiting the generality of the foregoing, you and NFT SportX agree
            that no dispute shall proceed by way of class arbitration without
            the written consent of all affected parties. If a decision is issued
            stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any part of
            this subsection’s limitations as to a given claim for relief, then
            that claim must be severed from the arbitration and brought in the
            state or federal courts located in the Mexican state of Coahuila.
            All other claims shall be arbitrated. Severability. Except as
            provided in this Section, if any part or parts of this Arbitration
            Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable,
            then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and
            shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement
            shall continue in full force and effect. Survival of Agreement. This
            Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your
            relationship with NFT SportX. Modification. Notwithstanding any
            provision in these Terms to the contrary, we agree that if NFT
            SportX makes any future material change to this Arbitration
            Agreement, you may reject that change within thirty (30) days of
            such change becoming effective by writing to NFT SportX at the
            following address: Blvd. Corporativo No. 135 Col. Los Parques CP
